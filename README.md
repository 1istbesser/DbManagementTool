# DbManagementTool
This is a simple database management tool in Java that makes it easy for you to add/ delete/ change records of MySQL databases. 

I'm dealing often with updating and adding records into databases for websites and while there are good tools available out there, I wanted to be able to customize it for my needs.

To get the project set up, you need to import the Java classes, create a resource folder called "images" and move the db4.png image there and obviously, you have to make sure you have the mysql-connector-java-5.1.40 library referenced to your project. If you don't have the library, you can download it from here: http://www.tamerinblog.com/download/mysql-connector-java-5.1.40.zip
